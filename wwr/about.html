                <h2>History</h2>
                <p><p>
                    River Gliding began as a wild dream in the summer of 1985, when three lifelong friends—Jack, Sam, and Lucy—found themselves 
                    stranded on the banks of the roaring Thunder River after a camping trip gone wrong. With no way to hike back, they crafted 
                    makeshift rafts from fallen trees and braved the rapids to get home. Along the way, they discovered the thrill of white water 
                    rafting and an untapped passion for adventure.
                    <br><br>
                    What started as a daring escape turned into a vision for sharing that excitement with others. By 1986, the trio had officially 
                    founded River Gliding, starting with a single raft and the rugged determination to conquer nature’s most challenging rivers. 
                    Word spread quickly about their crazy but exhilarating river runs, and soon, thrill-seekers from across the country flocked 
                    to join the ride.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, River Gliding has grown into a top-rated adventure company, with a fleet of state-of-the-art rafts and experienced guides 
                    who share Jack, Sam, and Lucy’s original spirit of daring exploration. From beginners to expert rafters, River Gliding is proud 
                    to offer wild and memorable journeys for all!
